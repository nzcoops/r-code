# Default values for males and females are "M" and "F" respectively, this can be specified by the user
# Key variable names are assumed to be all in lower case, this can be specified by the user

# Note:
# 'ht_perc' vector should be a character not a factor, taking only the values "5th","10th","25th","50th","75th","90th" and "95th"
# use 'child_height_percentile_v0.9.r' or later to create this vector
# currently age is rounded using a 'swedish rounding' type system, 3.4 will become 3 while 3.6 will become 4
# if you feel this is not appropriate then please set your age column to 0 dp using the rule you would prefer
# prior to submitting
